# UBlacklist Site Blocking Lists

**WIP (started 15 Nov 2024)**

These lists will be a combination of manually blocked sites and algorithmic blocking of certain website networks.

To block the websites in these lists using \@\iorate's uBlacklist ([docs](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs); [repo](https://github.com/iorate/ublacklist)):
1. Install the uBlacklist extension
  - [Chrome Extension](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/ublacklist/pncfbmialoiaghdehhbnbhkkgmjanfhe)
  - [Firefox Add-on](https://addons.mozilla.org/en-US/firefox/addon/ublacklist/)
  - [iOS App for Safari](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/ublacklist-for-safari/id1547912640)
2. Follow the instructions on the extension's website: [Advanced Features > Subscription](https://iorate.github.io/ublacklist/docs/advanced-features#subscription)


Once the blacklists are completed, I will add a masterlist.
